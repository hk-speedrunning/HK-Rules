(These notes are based on https://drop.rixx.de/JjBs/ )

General remarks:
- use benchwarp, s+q is slower!!! And don't forget to set a kb shortcut to warp
- notes use [stag] (levers) {geo}
- route requires a bit of incidental geo. The only two points where you should really check your geo are:
  * before King Station, kill enemies above ks if you have less than 300 geo
  * when you go to basin you need 450 geo, but your last chance to get them is hw*rmp arena
  * more detailed (but a bit outdated for lategame) geo count here: https://drop.rixx.de/qQl/
- if you want, you can get ddark after the last peak lever (it's roughly 20s slower but makes bosses easier)
